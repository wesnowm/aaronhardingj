# next-firebase-auth
Simple Firebase authentication for all Next.js rendering strategies

###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🌍 &nbsp; Support for all Next.js rendering strategies
######  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🔒 &nbsp; Signed, secure, http-only cookies by default
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🆔 &nbsp; Server-side access to the Firebase user ID token
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ↩️ &nbsp; Built-in support for redirecting based on the user’s auth status

## What It Does
This package makes the authenticated Firebase user and ID token easily available for both client-side and server-side rendering (SSR).

We treat the Firebase JS SDK as the source of truth for auth status. When the user signs in, we call an endpoint to generate a refresh token and store the user info, ID token, and refresh token in cookies. Future requests to SSR pages receive the user info and ID token from cookies, refreshing the ID token as needed. When the user logs out, we unset the cookies.

## Demo
[See a live demo](https://nfa-example.vercel.app/) of the [example app](https://github.com/gladly-team/next-firebase-auth/tree/main/example).

## When (Not) to Use this Package

This package makes it easy to access the Firebase user and ID token regardless of the Next.js rendering strategy. However, depending on your app's needs, other approaches might work better for you.

**If your app only uses static pages** or doesn't need the Firebase user for SSR, use the Firebase JS SDK directly to load the user on the client side.
  * *Pros:* It's simpler and removes this package as a dependency.
  * *Cons:* You will not have access to the Firebase user when you use `getServerSideProps`.

**If your app needs the Firebase user for SSR (but does not need the ID token server-side)**, you could consider one of these approaches: 
  1. On the client, set a JavaScript cookie with the Firebase user information once the Firebase JS SDK loads.
      * *Pros:* You won't need login/logout API endpoints. You can include any auth data you'd like, so you can add custom claims, which are not currently supported by this package.
      * *Cons:* The cookie will be unsigned and accessible to other JavaScript, making this approach less secure. You won't always have access to the Firebase ID token server-side, so you won't be able to access other Firebase services. (Note that you can set the ID token in the cookie, but it will expire after an hour and be invalid for future server-side-rendered pages.)
  2. Use [Firebase's session cookies](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/manage-cookies).
      * *Pros:* You'll have server-side access to custom claims and the ability to check for token revocation, which are not currently supported by this package.
      * *Cons:* You won't have access to the Firebase ID token server-side, so you won't be able to access other Firebase services. You'll need to implement logic for verifying the session and managing session state.

## Get Started

Install:

`yarn add next-firebase-auth`

Make sure peer dependencies are also installed:

`yarn add firebase firebase-admin next react react-dom`

Create a module to initialize `next-firebase-auth` with your options:

```js
// initAuth.js
import { init } from 'next-firebase-auth'

const initAuth = () => {
  init({
    authPageURL: '/auth',
    appPageURL: '/',
    loginAPIEndpoint: '/api/login',
    logoutAPIEndpoint: '/api/logout',
    firebaseAdminInitConfig: {
      credential: {
        projectId: 'my-example-app-id',
        clientEmail: 'example-abc123@my-example-app.iam.gserviceaccount.com',
        // This must not be accesssible client side.
        privateKey: process.env.FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY,
      },
      databaseURL: 'https://my-example-app.firebaseio.com',
    },
    firebaseClientInitConfig: {
      apiKey: 'MyExampleAppAPIKey123',
      authDomain: 'my-example-app.firebaseapp.com',
      databaseURL: 'https://my-example-app.firebaseio.com',
      projectId: 'my-example-app-id',
    },
    cookies: {
      name: 'ExampleApp',
      // Keys must not be accessible client side.
      keys: [
        process.env.COOKIE_SECRET_CURRENT,
        process.env.COOKIE_SECRET_PREVIOUS,
      ],
      httpOnly: true,
      maxAge: 12 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000, // twelve days
      overwrite: true,
      path: '/',
      sameSite: 'strict',
      secure: true, // set this to false in local (non-HTTPS) development
      signed: true,
    },
  })
}

export default initAuth

```
